# DefinitelyNotSHC

BetterDiscord has set into effect some new [plugin guidelines](https://docs.betterdiscord.app/plugins/introduction/guidelines/) that block plugins like ShowHiddenChannels from being distributed on their site. DevilBro also went to the effort of using BDFDB to automatically update ShowHiddenChannels to a non-functional version (v9.9.9) which just tells you to delete it. This plugin has the latest version of ShowHiddenChannels tweaked to bypass BDFDB's auto-updates. 

Keep in mind that if BDFDB or Discord itself have any big changes, this plugin will probably break. I'll do my best to keep this plugin up to date.

## Installation
- Just drop the .plugin.js file into your plugins folder. 
- If you want to rename the file, keep in mind that BDFDB automatically updates any file called ShowHiddenChannels.plugin.js to the v9.9.9 version.
