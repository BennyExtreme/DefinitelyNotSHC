# DefinitelyNotSHC

**DISCORD HAS BEEN UPDATED AND THIS PLUGIN NO LONGER WORKS. You can find an alternative [here](https://github.com/JustOptimize/return-ShowHiddenChannels).**

BetterDiscord has set into effect some new [plugin guidelines](https://docs.betterdiscord.app/plugins/introduction/guidelines/) that block plugins like ShowHiddenChannels from being distributed on their site. DevilBro also went to the effort of using BDFDB to automatically update SHC to a non-functional version (v9.9.9) which just tells you to delete it.

This plugin has the latest version of SHC tweaked to bypass BDFDB's auto-updates. 

Keep in mind that if BDFDB or Discord itself have any big changes, this plugin will probably break. I'll do my best to keep this plugin up to date.

You can find the last version of SHC [here](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/blob/b510da9b3ad72ba3b773f7d79e391a459f31732d/Plugins/ShowHiddenChannels/ShowHiddenChannels.plugin.js) (no longer works).
## Installation
- Drop the [DefinitelyNotSHC.plugin.js file](https://github.com/maromalo/DefinitelyNotSHC/releases/download/v3.2.5/DefinitelyNotSHC.plugin.js) into your plugins folder. 
- Reload the plugin.
- If you want to rename the file, keep in mind that BDFDB automatically updates any file called ShowHiddenChannels.plugin.js to the v9.9.9 version.
